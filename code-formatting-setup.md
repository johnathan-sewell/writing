## EditorConfig
Use it to override the IDE settings such as indent size, indent type (tabs/spaces), characterset, trimming whitespace, inserting trailing newlines, etc. It ensure contributers to the project are automatically using the correct IDE settings.

Many editors support it without plugins, otherwise there are many plugins, eg `EditorConfig` for Sublime Text.
